Oftentimes I would find him in his study without so much as a candle lit, a full moon casting its negative shadow over jumbles of papers and experiments, singing softly by the window. Had I not been there to guide him through the ruggedest part of the journey (bouts of melancholy, brain fever, fits, etc.), the project surely would have failed. We were fortunate enough to leave that outermost place with what seventeen minutes of material we found. What else can be said of Emily's poetry that hasn't yet? The quaintness belies its extremity - to be touched by it is to apprehend Eternity.\"<br><br>-Bugnu, October 2022",

    "description": "Tubis is an audio-visual meditation on Ohio’s clay-rich soil. A musical piece written for 5 tubas and electronics, the music was originally composed as part of an installation in composer Katarina Mazur’s backyard, and was presented via a wireless speaker hidden in a large rusty tube.\n\n“Forgotten histories enshrined in a living sculptural environment of foraged objects and plant materials [...] When the corona virus struck, the installation was moved to my backyard, where I continued to meditate on its energies. The installation inspired awareness of the changing of seasons and topography of my little piece of land behind the Mickey Mart gas station and convenience store. The walnut saplings and cleavers hugged the objects. The grass grew greener. The crocuses sang their nightly song with the peepers. Tubis became a home to the sweet spirits of Spring and Summer.” – Katarina Mazur, Composer/Director",

In 2008, I was interviewing Kurt Rosenwinkel for my blog, Camp Studio, and he sent me his recording (still unreleased as of May 2024) of his song “Time Machine.” From the moment I heard it preternaturally unspool, I knew—and this remains the case—“This is my favorite song.” Kurt is releasing his Ultimate Book of Compositions on his label, Heartcore Records. “Time Machine” is in there, along with 57 other unreleased songs, in the expansive digital materials that accompany the physical book. 💕 Here is my arrangement, featuring Inverted Tuning classical guitar and my beloved soprano Yamaha Venova.\" Video by Chris Weisman and elie mcafee-hahn.

BLUE DISH usher in a new season of soothing music with the release of their new music video on YouTube today. <br><br> BLUE DISH is excited to release their new single Song of Blue, Knight of DISH. It's an acoustic guitar piece, performed by the duo known as BLUE DISH. <br><br>In this video, you will see them playing their guitars. The film is set in a small castle. The castle is not real but is made out of paper to create a playful medieval atmosphere.The musicians were shot alone and later added to the scene using green screen technology.<br><br>Although the setting is medieval, the songs are contemporary. This creates an interesting mix of old and new. <br> The video shows various parts of the castle as the musicians perform, and you 'll notice that the castle hasn't changed - it 's still very simple, like Focus on the music. Throughout the entire film, there are no other characters, just the musicians and the castle.It's a simple performance that highlights BLUE DISH's soundtrack and the unique setting they chose.The simplicity of the film lets you focus on the music as well as the creative visual style. <br><br>BLUE DISH hope you enjoy this video and their new song Song of blue, knight of dish.The video is now available for you to watch on YouTube.",
