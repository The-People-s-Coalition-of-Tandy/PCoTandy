                    Born in Hiroshima, currently lives in Kyoto. In 1998, he made his debut with the album "unrest" from
                    Sublime Records.
                    His unique sound, which seems to be a complex fusion of techno, jazz, and fusion, has gained
                    acclaim.
                    After that, he released "opa*q" in 1999 and "red curb" in 2001, and was praised by many artists as a
                    leader in new electronic music,
                    producing songs for Akiko Yano, UA, Great3, etc., as well as producing music for Kururi and
                    Takemura.
                    He has collaborated across genres, remixing songs by many artists such as Enkazu and Cold Cut (UK).
                    He has participated in festivals in France, Germany, etc., as well as Fuji Rock Festival, RISING SUN
                    ROCK FESTIVAL, and Kururi presents Hyakki Yagyo.
                    He just released their long-awaited new album ''lust'' on May 25, 2005, his first in four years.

          This interview features Rei Harakami, who released his 4th album "lust" on May 25th.
          Mr. Harakami seems to be using SC-88pro and VS-2000CD.
          We visited Harakami's label Sublime Records in Tokyo to talk about his new album, songwriting, and more.

                  that's right. Basically two SC-88Pros. I also use SK-88Pro and VS-2000CD.
                  Up until the third album, ``Red Curb,'' I created the entire record using the SC-88Pro,
                  and then just added a total EQ at the end.
                  This time, the album was a little different, and I recorded the two channels of the SC-88Pro
                  onto the VS-2000CD, as well as a separate version of the tracks, and compared them.
                  I wanted to try which one was better.
